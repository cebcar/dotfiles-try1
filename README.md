# dotfiles
initially based on udemy course dotfiles.eieio.xyz

Learning about dotfiles

## TODO (automate)
- Terminal Preferences
- changed shell to zsh
- dock preferenceas
- mission control preferences
- Finder show path bar
- Trackpad (3-finger drag on; tap to click off)
- .zshrc
- Git config, SSH

## restarting course on 220622
We tried to watch, do, and document all at the same time.
That did not work.
This time, we plan, a section at a time, to:
- watch and document/plan
- then implement from our own instructions

## my initial System Preferences changes
Security and Privacy : General
- (+) use your Apple Watch to unlock apps and your Mac

Displays
- Reduce brightness

We have also
- printed to my HP OfficeJet Pro 6960; "just worked" (no configuration needed; ~/.cups appeared as expected)
- used Safari freely, including editing GitHub issues and content, with no Preferences changes
- Home Directory shows no changes not already expected (.cups dir for printer, .zsh_ history, sessions)
